# Reference Typeface

These are early prototype files, mapping out the dimensions of a coming font by Niklas Ekholm, to be released by Helsinki Type Studio.

# 3D

This typeface has 12 master forming three dimensions of interpolation. For clarity in the defelopment phase, the weight is named thickness, to get three axes Thickness (t), Width (w), Roundness (r).

Eero Pitk√§nen gracefully helped visualize the dimensions. In the CodePen preview you can zoom by scrolling vertically, pan with shift+drag, rotate with cmnd+drag sideways.

# Known bugs

The visualization only shows width values 100-500, because the wider glyphs reveal a strange rendering bug, cutting off the right edge of the glyph.
